<h1>CAL COMMIT</h1>
<p>We aspire to teach computer science students the world of collaboration. We will do so by contributing in open source projects on a weekly basis, this will teach students the significance of the Git software and Github/Gitlab. We will also be holding hackathons and be participating in competitions to gain rewards and do well in the competitive aspect. At the end of the year, students will be masters in Git and will be able to collaborate effectively.
